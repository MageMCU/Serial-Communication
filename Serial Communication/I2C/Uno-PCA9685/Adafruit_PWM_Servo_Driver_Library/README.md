## ***include folder***

- **Adafruit_PWMServoDriver.h**
    - (Please note that this header incorporates the methods which means there is no cpp file but please compare with the original code using Adafruit library for the 16-channel PWM and the Servo driver at Github (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-Library)). This library is used to free up Arduino pins by using the I2C bus.
